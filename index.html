          <p>Teaching and coaching mean a lot to me. It was my teachers and coaches in the past who motivated me to be where I am today. They have had a profound impact on me and continue to do so as I continue to think about how teaching and coaching will be a part of my life in my future endeavors.</p>

          <p>Keep Going Podcast: This podcast has quite literally changed my life.

          <p>This is my favorite guitar currently. It is my papaw's and he isn't with us anymore. It definitely reminds me of him when I play it and working with him at the deli back in the day.</p>
